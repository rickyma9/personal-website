		<!-- Description -->
		<p class ="center-text ">
			I'm Ricky Ma! Twenty years old and still a little weirded out by that.
			I'm a current Information Systems student at Carnegie Mellon University, pursuing minors in Human-Computer Interaction and Computer Science.
			I really like developing software, and hope to participate in something that can make a tangible impact for social good.

			Here are some of the projects I've worked on in the past years:

						<th>67250 <br /> The Information Systems Milleux </th>
						<td> Web Development Project </td>
						<td>Created a website using vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript that showed the details of a bakery's assorted goods, and options for ordering.
						    Here is a <a target="_blank" href="250-web-dev-proj/index.html">link to the project.</a></td>

						<th>Capital One Software Engineering Summit <br /> Hackathon</th>
						<td>UtiliTrend</td>
						<td>Created a webapp that would show people what their estimated utility costs would be based on what people in the area are paying.
						     It shows the average rates people are paying in a certain zip code based on Zillow API data and bank account information, then displays it in a chart.
						     Here is a link to the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rickyma9/capitalone-summit-challenge">GitHub repository</a> with the project.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>15112 <br /> Fundamentals of Programming</th>
						<td>Term Project</td>
						<td>Greated a graphical user interface and an interactive rhythm game where you can create your own beatmaps to play. This was the final 
						    porject that was given in the class to show what types of things I learned. Here is a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbCDIkDGkdQ">demonstration video</a> of the project.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr class="even">
						<th>05499 <br /> Persuasive Design</th>
						<td>Final Project Glow</td>
						<td>Worked in a team to design a chrome extension that would prompt users to choose more sustainable options, theoretically using some algorithm to determine similar products to the one users are currently looking at. Screenshots of examples of how the extension would look are below.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>70311<br /> Organizational Behavior</th>
						<td>Final Project Business Analysis</td>
						<td>Worked in a team to analyze an organization's strengths and weaknesses, and how it can use organizational behavior theories or motivation to improve the motivations of its memebers to participate in the organization more.</td>

					<tr class="even">
						<th>Capital One Software Engineering Summit <br /> Coding Challenge</th>
						<td>Jeopardy Search Engine</td>
						<td>Created a webapp that would show people what their estimated utility costs would be based on what people in the area are paying.
